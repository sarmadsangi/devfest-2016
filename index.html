            <p>Hi, I'm Zell. I started learning to design and code when I was 25. It was incredibly difficult at first because I had no background in design nor development. I came from Finance. </p>

            <p>I often got stuck since I was weak in my fundamentals. I’d find myself spending hours reading Stackoverflow answers and tutorials on other blogs to try and overcome my problems.</p>
