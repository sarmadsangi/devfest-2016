      **Zell** is the lead instructor. Like you, he came from a non-programming background (he has a business). He taught himself how to code on the side when he was 25 and has been freelancing and bootstrapping his company ever since.

      He authored two books---Learning Susy and Automate Your Workflow---and had written for well-known web publications like CSS Tricks and Smashing Magazine.
